I used the "Telegram.Bot" library.
The version of Telegram.Bot used is the latest available, 17.0.0
The version used of "Telegram.Bot.Extension.Polling" is 1.0.2.
I used Visual Studio 2022.
You can install both by going to: project, NuGet packets.
Search and install both and use the latest version available.
