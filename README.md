I used the "Telegram.Bot" library.
The version of Telegram.Bot used is the 17.0.0
The version used of "Telegram.Bot.Extension.Polling" is 1.0.2.
I used Visual Studio 2022.
You can install both by going to: project, NuGet packets.
Search and install both and use the latest version available.

New versions are now available. If you are interested in the latest versions, please check the official documentation directly.
